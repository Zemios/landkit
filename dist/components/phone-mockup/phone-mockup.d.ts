/**
 * PhoneMockupComponent
 *
 * A static, hand-drawn iPhone-shaped frame with a notch, status bar
 * and rounded screen. The contents of the screen are projected via
 * `<ng-content>` so each consumer can render its own header, list,
 * card, chat bubbles, etc. inside.
 *
 * Slots:
 * - default: main screen content (cards, lists, chat, whatever).
 * - [zPhoneStatus]:  small block rendered in the top status bar
 *   (overrides the default 09:41 + signal/battery row).
 * - [zPhoneHeader]: optional header row (e.g. a brand label + bell).
 * - [zPhoneTabbar]: optional tabbar pinned at the bottom of the
 *   screen.
 *
 * The component is self-contained: it ships its own scoped styles
 * sourced from `var(--zemios-*)`, so it works in any app regardless
 * of the consumer's CSS framework (no Tailwind utility required).
 *
 * Sizing: the frame is 180x360px on mobile and 210x420px on desktop.
 * Override via the `tilt` input to lean the phone left or right
 * inside a hero composition.
