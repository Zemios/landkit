/**
 * MadeByComponent
 *
 * Reusable "made by Zemios" attribution badge. Two visual variants:
 *
 * - `plain` (default): minimal text link, opacity 0.55, suitable for
 *   sidebars and inline footers where you want the badge to blend
 *   into the page chrome.
 * - `pill`: the rounded pill with a heart icon, a "with love" word in
 *   the brand rose colour, and a hover-state that lifts the background
 *   opacity. Suited for marketing-page footers on a dark surface.
 *
 * `theme` controls the heart / accent colour contrast. `light` is the
 * default (rose-400 works on both light and dark backgrounds). `dark`
 * lightens the heart to a softer rose-300 and bumps the link weight.
 *
 * Every colour / radius / shadow in the component is sourced from
 * `var(--zemios-*)` so it stays on brand automatically under any
 * theme (light, dark or neon).
